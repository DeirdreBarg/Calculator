**Project: Build a Basic Calculator in C**

**Objective:**
Create a simple calculator program in the C programming language that can perform basic arithmetic operations and prompt the user for input.

**Requirements:**

1. Your calculator should be able to perform the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. When the program starts, display a welcome message and instructions on how to use the calculator.
3. Prompt the user to enter two numbers and the desired arithmetic operation.
4. Perform the selected operation on the two numbers and display the result.
5. Make sure to handle division by zero gracefully and provide an appropriate error message.
6. Implement a user-friendly loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program, unless they choose to do so.

**Bonus (Optional):**
Add more advanced features like exponentiation or square roots to your calculator for an extra challenge!

**Guidelines:**

- Write your code in a clear and organized manner, using appropriate variable names and comments to explain your logic.
- Remember to follow good programming practices, such as avoiding code duplication and using functions to modularize your code.
- Use separate code snippets for imports (if any) and the actual calculator code.
- You're encouraged to use online resources and the C programming documentation to learn about basic input/output and arithmetic operations.

**Submission:**
Once you've completed your calculator, share your C source code file with explanations of how your program works. You can also provide a brief reflection on what you've learned while working on this project.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance along the way. Happy coding!
